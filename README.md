# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

This project demonstrates the dynamic content and tables JavaScript can create using UFO sighting data. The project consists of a table using data stored in a JavaScript array and filters, making this table fully dynamic. The table can react to user input and is displayed in an HTML file for easy viewing. 

## Results:

The webpage welcomes visitors with an introduction that prompts users to dig through the data using the filter search table below.

The table consists of search filters on the left side of the screen, and the filtered data will display on the right. The search filters include date, city, state, country, and shape. It allows users to screen for multiple criteria simultaneously by inputting the desired search and hitting the enter key.

## Tools:
- JavaScript
- D3.js
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap v4.0
## Summary:

One drawback to the webpage is the display of the data table. The data table should appear on the right side of the screen, but some comments are too long to display on the right. That is why the table sometimes appears below and sometimes to the right of the search filters. 

To improve the website for further development, I would display the table below the search filters and change the search filter display from vertical to horizontal. Another improvement I recommend is showing an interactive map display with all the ufo sightings, so users can visualize the data and create their own conclusions. I recommend visualizing the geographic data with the Google Maps API or Tableau.
